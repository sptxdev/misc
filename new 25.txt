Dear colleagues,

TLDR:
Some alternatives for process automation tools/languages
(Point And Click): KNIME, SAS
(Coding): R(+RStudio), Python and of course SQL.

Long read:

Sorry for taking so long to come up with this 1st post, but i thought it would be a good idea to collect some of the links to some YouTube video first, which are relevant to our discussion.
As for videos below feel free to glance through some of them if needed(double speed, don't spend more than 5-10 minutes, on each, no need to watch them in entirety).

A bit on Automation in super general way, just to get started, mostly general sense:
Automation 101 - Getting Started With Automation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKpJRKam-fA
(This specific video focuses on RPA - which is one type of possible automation. We wont be focusing on these in our activities(as these are usually implemented by enterprise rather then by users), but its good to know that these also exist, and are extremely good tools for standard processes.)

Some of the tools for automation which are closer for our reality are these (not a complete or final list, just some of the names):
Some alternatives for process automation tools/languages
General purpose:
(Point And Click): KNIME, SAS
(Coding): R(+RStudio), Python and of course SQL.
Other tools for scheduling and test automation: 
Jenkins(scheduling), Selenium(web testing), Cucumber(web testing) (we wont be focusing on these, but just to know that they exist).

KNIME:
KNIME User Session - Financial Applications of Self-Service ETL and Geospatial Analysis-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_44RWBmHVro

SAS:
SAS is a commercial software which in functionality quite similar to KNIME:
A rather long intro to the basic functionality:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEY9iR_0IjY (SAS Tutorial | Getting Started with SAS Enterprise Guide (Extended Version))

R(+Rstudio):
R is a powerful language with many libraries - a top 2 choice for statisticians/mathematicians, similar to Python in functiuonality:
Just a quick video on working with R(+Rstudio):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVKMsaWju8w (Getting started with R and RStudio)
Here is a website that tells about practical workflow around R, (click around, don't waste too much time)
https://datacarpentry.org/rr-automation/
A good site about R use cases is this one:
https://www.r-bloggers.com/
And here is what people are saying about R automation:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rlanguage/comments/6cvyqe/what_are_some_office_tasks_youve_automated_using_r/
Some of the best R libraries are these:

Python:
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
Super popular. Has 1000's of librairies
Python is usually used via some code editor, such as:
Jupyter, Visual Studio Code, or PyCharm(commercial)
Best to install as Anaconda distribution - as setting up of environment is a bit of headache.

A good intro on data processing in Python (you can ignore other videos on python, but do take a look at this one, if you have not worked with Python before):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXhED53VZ50 (Data Analysis with Python for Excel Users)

A bit on Python+Jupyter notebook installed via Anaconda distribution:
(Jupyter Notebook Tutorial | Introduction To Jupyter Notebook | Python Jupyter Notebook | Simplilearn)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C9E2yPBw7s

A bit on practical pain points in Excel vs Python - mostly for information (don't take this one too seriously)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH3chLfQayo (Automating Excel with Python)

A very simplified business case (again don't take this too seriously): 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On4bL4tSZzg (Schedule and Automate Your Excel Data Analytics with Python)

SQL:
Needs no presentation. 
Here is a short video on basic functionality of SQL:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEtnYWuo2Bw (Learn Basic SQL in 10 Minutes)

So there you have it.
There is of course numbers of other tools available, but most likely in the short term we will be focusing on these ones.
This also gives a little bit perspective of the options that we have.

Sincerely,
